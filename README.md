## DEPLOYED CONTRACTS:

Contract can be found at /contract/getmepizza.sol. The contract takes in tips and assigns them to the creator to later withdraw from the users dashboard. It also issues a multichain token as a coupon to the tipper and stores the tip detail (to, from, memo, date, amount, slices) in a struct so we can display them on our front-end in the users profile page.

### MAINNETS:

Polygon:

## HACKATHON NOTES:

The dapp is 100% functional and deployed on Mainnets.

- Moralis functions have all been placed in /pages/libs/moralis.ts as exports/hooks.
- Chainlink is used in the smart contracts found in /contract/getmepizza.sol and called in /pages/components/BuyPizza.tsx using wagmi.
- Multichain has been implemented to make $🍕 points cross-chain found in /contract/getmepizza.sol

Moralis EVM API is used:

1. To upload profile images to IPFS. (/pages/admin.tsx & /pages/enter.tsx)
2. To get memo structs Array for creator from smart contract. (/pages/components/Supporters.tsx)
3. To get withdrawable tip balance for creator from smart contract. (/pages/dashboard.tsx)
