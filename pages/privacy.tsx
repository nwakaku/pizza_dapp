              Get Me Pizza is a platform for creators to accept support from
              their audience and share exclusive content. At Get Me Pizza, your
              privacy is important to us, and we want you to feel confident that
              your personal information is secure when using our products and
              our platform. The services are provided by Get Me Pizza, a South
              African sole prop run by @elonsdev. It is Get Me Pizza’s policy to
              respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
              while operating our website.
            </p>
            <h1 className="mt-8 mb-2  font-bold text-xl">Website Visitors</h1>
            <p className="">
              Like most website operators, Get Me Pizza collects
              non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
              browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
              type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time
              of each visitor request. Get Me Pizza&apos;s purpose in collecting
              non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
              Get Me Pizza&apos;s visitors use its website. From time to time,
              Get Me Pizza may release non-personally-identifying information in
              the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage
              of its website. Get Me Pizza also collects potentially
              personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
              addresses, email, and EVM addresses for logged in users and for
              users making payments on Pizza_Park.Pizza. Get Me Pizza only
              discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
              circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
              information as described below, except that payee IP addresses and
              email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of
              Get Me Pizza and payment processing is publicly available on the
              blockchain.
            </p>
            <h1 className="mt-8 mb-2  font-bold text-xl">Payments</h1>
            <p className="">
              To make a payment to a creator on Get Me Pizza, you have to
              connect your wallet. We use Wagmi SDK which provides us with a
              token that represents your wallet, and allows us to suggest a
              transaction to your wallet. Processing information about the
              creators you support, the level at which you support them, what
              rewards you receive and how often you support them are all
              publicly available on the blockchain.

              Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
            </h1>
            <p className="">
              Certain visitors to Get Me Pizza&apos;s websites choose to
              interact with Get Me Pizza in ways that require Get Me Pizza to
              gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
              information that Get Me Pizza gathers depends on the nature of the
              interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at Get Me
              Pizza with Google Auth and Twitter Auth which provides us with the
              users email, profile picture, and name. Those who engage in
              transactions with Get Me Pizza are asked to provide additional
              information, including as necessary the wallet required to process
              those transactions. In each case, Get Me Pizza collects such
              information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill
              the purpose of the visitor&apos;s interaction with Get Me Pizza.
              Get Me Pizza does not disclose personally-identifying information
              other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to
              supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it
              may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
              activities.

              necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,

              A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
              visitor&apos;s computer, and that the visitor&apos;s browser
              provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Get Me
              Pizza uses cookies to help Get Me Pizza identify and track
              visitors, their usage of Get Me Pizza website, and their website
              access preferences. Some cookies expire after a certain amount of
              time, or upon logging out (session cookies), others remain on your
              computer or terminal device for a longer period (persistent
              cookies). Our Site uses first party cookies (cookies set directly
              by Anchor) as well as third party cookies, as described below: -
              Strictly Necessary Cookies: Used to provide Users with the
              Services available through our Site and to use some of their
              features, such as the ability to log-in and access to secure
              areas. These cookies are served by Anchor and are essential for
              using and navigating the Site. Without these cookies, basic
              functions of our Site would not work. Because these cookies are
              strictly necessary to deliver the Site and the Services, you
              cannot refuse them. - Analytics/Performance: Used to better
              understand the behavior of the Users on our Site and improve our
              Site accordingly, for example by making sure Users are finding
              what they need easily. The Site uses Google Analytics, a web
              analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”). The
              information collected by Google (including your IP address) will
              be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United
              States (Google is certified to the Privacy Shield for data
              transfers). How long a Google Analytics cookie remains on your
              computer or device depends on what it is and what it is used for.
              Some Google Analytics cookies expire at the end of your browser
              session, whilst others can remain for up to two years. You can
              prevent your data from being collected by Google Analytics on our
              Site by downloading and installing the Google Analytics Opt-out
              Browser Add-on for your current web browser. Get Me Pizza visitors
              who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should
              set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Get Me
              Pizza&apos;s websites, with the drawback that certain features of
              Get Me Pizza&apos;s websites may not function properly without the
              aid of cookies.
