            <h1 className="mt-8 mb-2  font-bold text-xl">When 🍕?</h1>
            <p className=" ">
              Get me pizza is built out of a personal need to allow my followers
              to support me with small amounts of crypto in a more meaningful
              way than just asking to gib moneys. Then I thought... Hey, maybe
              artists, influencers, and other creators could use this too.
            </p>
            <h1 className="mt-8 mb-2  font-bold text-xl">Why 🍕?</h1>
            <p className="">
              Short answer: Who doesn&apos;t like Pizza? Without pizza, we would
              have no Bitcoins...
              <br />
              <br /> Longer answer: I thought it would be fun to allow
              supporters to tip in pizza slice value instead of dollars and mint
              the supporter a $PIZZA coupons that shows their support for the
              creator. I want to expand the idea into token-gating posts and
              content, creating an economy around $PIZZA coupons, and allow web3
              creators to un-tap their full value creation.
            </p>
            <h1 className="mt-8 mb-2  font-bold text-xl">
              How do I get paid in 🍕?
            </h1>
            <p className="">
              Every time a supporter tips you a $1 slice they get 1 $PIZZA
              coupon proving their support and the crypto goes into a smart
              contract mapped to your ETH address. You can withdraw these funds
              anytime from your dashboard or directly from the smart contract.
              You don&apos;t actually get pizza, but you could buy yourself one,
              or anything else, once you withdraw your funds.

              How can my fans pay?
            </h1>
            <p className="">
              Currently support is available to a wide range of blockchains
              namely: BSC, POLYGON & FANTOM... more coming soon.
            </p>
            <h1 className="mt-8 mb-2  font-bold text-xl">Is there a fee?</h1>
            <p className="">
              It is completely free to sign up and create posts. The smart
              contract takes 5% on every tip to pay for development and servers.

              What are 🍕 points?
            </h1>
            <p className="">
              🍕 points are blockchain tokens that supporters receive when
              tipping a creator. They are cross-chain and can be swapped between
              chains on{" "}

              🍕 points will be used on future features such as buying digital

            <p className="">
              Instead of giving everyone a blank blue egg or some such nonsense,
              we thought it would be fun to generate a random profile picture
              for you, using Dicebear.com (micah) API, seeded with your user UID
              we generate when you sign up.
